    The following code implements a deterministic N-dimensional smooth
    64-bit integer noise function. This function hasn't been tested extensively.
    
    Also the "det_point_noise64" function should probably be improved or
    replaced with something faster.
    
    It doesn't rely on any third party libraries except boost::multiprecision,
    which can be substituited for any library that provides a 128-bit 
    unsigned integer.
    
    Any donations would be appreciated. :)
